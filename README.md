# 🧮 Internship Task 1 - Fibonacci Generator in Python

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** of my internship program.  
The task was to build a **simple Fibonacci number generator** using Python, without using recursion or lists.

---

## 🚀 Task Objective

✔️ Create a program that generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using a basic loop structure.

✔️ Output should be printed directly, not returned as a list or stored in any data structure.

---

## 📄 Code Description

- Uses two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of Fibonacci numbers.
- Uses a simple `for` loop to print `n` numbers.
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand.
